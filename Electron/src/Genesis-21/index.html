            <p>Problem Statement : (INTL-DA-08)
              Build a solution that is able to track the origin of a given social media post (provided as an input URL
              or content) and identify the account, along with its details, which posted it first on that particular
              platform</p>

            <p>Presentation Video Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-HmjKApXIs</p>

            <h1 id="1-abstract">1. Abstract:</h1>

            <p>Images/ videos of individuals, taken with or without consent and often of a sexually-explicit nature, are
              posted on various social media platforms as a tactic of abuse by perpetrators with the intent to harass,
              impersonate, humiliate and cause harm. Such content has a tendency to instantly become viral and causes a
              lot of distress to the victim.
              Given a piece of text, image, or video snippet as input, we build a solution that can identify the person
              who was the first one to post it online on a particular social media platform.
              We give a detailed report on how we reached a particular result.
              This project will have a high real-time use as it solves one of the major problems faced by our society.
            </p>

            <h1 id="2-introduction">2. Introduction:</h1>

            <p>We tend to take advantage of the vast and interactive platform of social media, but we forget to notice
              the downside of it. Nowadays, even a single post can ruin a person’s life, and yet we have failed to stop
              it. So our project will be a milestone in making people’s lives better. Every day, we see hundreds of
              messages forwarded across the globe, and it is almost impossible for us to find the origin of it. Once any
              content is released, it is shared, re-posted, and forwarded many times than we can imagine. This becomes a
              vulnerability. Hence, we are proposing a way to find the origin of any post. Thus, we find the user
              responsible for releasing abusive content. Our project uses image hashing to identify and compare the
              content that is retrieved from any media. Further, using a real-time database the information is organized
              and stored. Finally, the data is mapped to its origin for the first time it was ever posted.</p>

            <h1 id="3-techstack">3. Techstack:</h1>

            <p>Language: Python 3.0
              Libraries: ImageHash, Ipyplot, Numpy, Pandas, BeautifulSoup</p>

            <p>Python 3.0</p>

            <p>Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language.
              Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation.
              Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear,
              logical code for a small and large-scale project.
              Python 3 is a new version of the language.
              We considered python due to its richness in libraries and the flexibility offered by it.
              Python also shines bright in the data science area as it has numerous built-in features which makes it
              easy to tackle the needs.</p>

            <p>Libraries:</p>

            <p>ImageHash</p>

            <p>Image hashes tell whether two images look nearly identical. This is different from cryptographic hashing
              algorithms where tiny changes in the image give completely different hashes. In image fingerprinting, we
              actually want our similar inputs to have similar output hashes as well. The image hash algorithms
              (average, perceptual, difference, wavelet) analyze the image structure on luminance (without color
              information). The color hash algorithm analyses the color distribution and black &amp; gray fractions
              (without position information).</p>

            <p>Ipyplot</p>

            <p>IPyPlot is a small python package offering fast and efficient plotting of images inside ipython Notebooks
              cells. It’s using IPython with HTML for faster, richer, and more interactive ways of displaying big
              numbers of images.</p>

            <p>Numpy
              NumPy stands for Numerical Python. It is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has
              functions for working in the domain of linear algebra, Fourier transform, and matrices. It is an
              open-source project and we can use it freely. In Python, we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays,
              but they are slow to process.NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than
              traditional Python lists.</p>

            <p>Pandas
              pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make
              working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental
              high-level building block for doing practical, real-world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has
              the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open-source data analysis/manipulation tool
              available in any language</p>

            <p>Our algorithm is divided into four stages as follows:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Data scraping</li>
              <li>Sanitizing &amp; Organising data</li>
              <li>Origin Computation</li>
              <li>Compiling Report.</li>
            </ol>

            <h1 id="411-data-scraping">4.1.1 Data Scraping:</h1>

            <h1 id="4111-effective-way-of-searching">4.1.1.1 Effective way of searching:</h1>

            <p>In order to make scraping for images more effective, we have developed an algorithm that uses hashtags (
              # tags ) to navigate to the main page and narrows the scope of the search, this helps in reducing the
              waste of computational power spent on a broader search. However, if the algorithm cannot find any hashtags
              associated with the given post, it can get manual input from the user at the time of triggering else will
              launch a broader search based on location and other aspects</p>

            <h1 id="4112--data-retrieved">4.1.1.2 Data retrieved:</h1>

            <p>On exploring every new node we collect the following data for processing</p>

            <p>Time and date of the post (if the post is relatively old, only the date)
              The URL of the image involved in the post
              Account username
              Social interactions (number of likes and comments)
              Hashtags used (or the equivalent - depending on the social media platform)</p>

            <h1 id="412-sanitizing--organising-data">4.1.2 Sanitizing &amp; Organising data</h1>

            <p>To process the data we collect, we first should organize the data. Considering the vast amounts of data
              we need to process, we build the solution in such a way that we collect data to a centralized server. This
              enables distributive computing, by sharing workloads between an array of computers.</p>

            <p>Our scheme is as follows :</p>

            <h1 id="4121-hashing">4.1.2.1 Hashing:</h1>
            <p>To compare images between posts, we hash the images and compare the hash values, we designed special
              algorithms that use different hashing techniques to conclude whether two images are edits of the same post
            </p>

            <h1 id="4122-database">4.1.2.2 Database:</h1>

            <p>We are using Google’s Firebase Realtime Database as the centralized database solution for
              storing/retrieving node data and hash values for computation. This enables us to split work between
              different computers, improving the overall performance of our solution</p>

            <h1 id="4123-exporting-node-data">4.1.2.3 Exporting node data:</h1>

            <p>Node data can be exported into JSON files after exploration directly. These datasets can be used for
              other analytics, and further analysis of the case depending upon the initial report and situation.</p>

            <h1 id="413-origin-computation">4.1.3 Origin Computation:</h1>

            <p>To traceback to the original post, we have designed the algorithm as follows</p>

            <p>After retrieving data from RTDB, hashes will be sequentially processed to sort it in chronological order
              based on the time and date, in case of unavailability of certain data, it will be computed based on other
              parameters like the number of comments, shares, likes, and etc, creating a tree structure representing the
              flow of posts. Eventually, the start will be converging to fewer nodes. We then calculate the probability
              of being the origin for every node based on parameters other.</p>

            <h1 id="414-report">4.1.4 Report:</h1>

            <p>After computation to share the conclusions, we procedurally generate an HTML document and a pdf. The HTML
              document contains a very detailed flow of posts and data represented by every node in the network in a
              human-readable format. It will also contain additional data retrieved by the system and tooltips
              justifying the node’s position in the graph. The Pdf file will have a summary of the search and
              conclusions, without displaying any data.</p>

            <h1 id="42-accuracy-and-time">4.2 Accuracy and time:</h1>

            <p>In order to trace back to the origin, we need to search, index, and profile all the images under some
              constraints which take a tremendous amount of time and computation power, to tackle this we created
              different algorithms that balance the time and accuracy into different proportions, discussed more on the
              methods in the following section.</p>

            <p>Accuracy:</p>

            <p>we have estimated the accuracy of the most accurate method of this solution as at least 89%. The actual
              numbers can only be calculated on the completion of this project. It also depends greatly on the hashing
              algorithms we use, so in order to improve the accuracy of the algorithms, we sanitize the input image we
              provide for hashing, more details are mentioned in the following sections.</p>

            <h1 id="43-methods">4.3 Methods</h1>

            <p>Different methods we provide:</p>

            <h1 id="fastest-method">Fastest Method</h1>
            <p>Looks for the exact image, audio, video file - fails with edits and compression
              Uses a single hashing algorithm
              Fastest of all three methods
              Accuracy is less</p>

            <h1 id="normal-method">Normal Method</h1>
            <p>Uses two Hashing Algorithms
              Validation of search and computation
              Can tolerate minor compressions and edits
              More accurate than the previous method</p>

            <h1 id="deep-search">Deep search</h1>
            <p>Most accurate
              Takes more time relatively
              Accounts major edits and compression
              Uses several hashing techniques to validate results</p>

            <h1 id="additional-methods-optional">Additional Methods (Optional):</h1>
            <p>Search part of a picture (if the clue is suspected to be cropped picture)
              Adds to additional time in computing results
              A detailed report will be included with every branch
              Grid Verification: splits the image into 3x3 grid and algorithm proceeds individually with every piece,
              this increases the chance of matching the edited pictures</p>

            <h1 id="44-report-of-the-search">4.4 Report of the search</h1>

            <ol>
              <li>HTML file:</li>
            </ol>

            <p>1.1. Display the processed information.
              1.2. create a dynamic interactive graph to follow the flow of posts
              1.2.1. On hovering, it exposes the user to further data
              1.3.The nodes are displayed as cards
              1.3.1. It shows the navigation of posts</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Pdf-summary:</li>
            </ol>

            <p>It contains a detailed report based on the algorithm executed. It gives the conclusion, final result of
              the search to the end-user. This does not expose any intermediate node data or branch decisions.</p>
